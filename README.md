# Surf Buddy

Surf buddy is a web application tool used to help a surfer organize their surf equipment. The sweet addiction of surfing can only really be enjoyed when one is out on the water. Meaning the less time one has to spend outside of the water, the better. This tool keeps track of all the equipment surfers use. The biggest mistery of surfing is how much stuff a surfer can collect over the years. There always seems to be a "great deal" on a board and that box of fins never seems to get ant lighter. Surf buddy lets users keep track of their things and seemlessly update or remove them as things seem to change or soemthing is sold. This lets surfers know exactly what board surfable, sellable or ready to collect dust as wall art. A surfer easily find and collect everything needed hours beforehand. The surf buddy is the only way to surf.
